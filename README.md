# Image-Processor
COL215 : Digital Logic Programming Assignment
This is a VHDL program of Image Processor which can blur or sharpen images.
The images are sent in the .pgm format. They are greyscale. Switches can be used to change the output to sharper or smoother image.
The image is sent to the board using UART protocol at 9600 bauds. 
It is implemented using a XILINX BASYS Board and written in VHDL
It was completed in Fall 2017
